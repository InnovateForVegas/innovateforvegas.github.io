					<h3>Give a Listen!</h3>
					<p>
						We have a mostly-weekly audio program, published on Spotify and elsewhere, for discussions about Innovation, Hackathons, Projects, and more. As you read this, the episodes are pre-recorded
						and then posted, in the future we hope to enable a live streamed audio conversation (and then posting it later for posterity) and interaction with the live stream listeners. What about Video?
						Well let us get talks dot vegas up and running and we will get back to you!

					<h3>Join in!</h3>
					<p>
						Civic Volunteerism is a highly-visible way to elevate our communities, but we also enable volunteers to gain valuable job skills and new items on their CVs that are valuable during
						a job search or pursuit of higher education. Open source development is a learning opportunity, a teaching opportunity, and a winning opportunity, for those involved and for those who reap
						the benefits of these endeavors. When you meet the people who benefit from your work, in your neighborhood, at your school or workplace, or maybe just out and about, you learn
						directly what it means to make things for others. This is true in the workaday world, to be sure, but it is not every day that you interact with the people you have helped with your language
						translations, visualizations, audio transformations, human interfaces, and applications. Here, you can!
					</p>
					<p>
						People in our city and surrounding communities will often encounter a focus on 21+ events and gatherings. We encourage kids of all ages (with parental permission, if you please) to participate in our
						Monthly Hackathon Meetups, all projects, online activities, and everything else we do. We are proactively committed to inclusivity and to maintaining open doors for those
						of any age, an important part of our ethos.
					</p>
					<p>
						We thank you in advance for contributing your time and innovative creativity, no matter your age, interests, or skill set, because <strong>You Are Welcome</strong>.

					<h3>About Us</h3>
					<p>
						The Code for Vegas Foundation was rebooted from the original Code for Vegas in 2022, formed as an independent Nevada Nonprofit Corporation on 16 June 2022,
						and is a 501(c)(3) public charity determined by the IRS, effective retroactively from the time of our formation.
						While we had kept the name of our predecessor organization formed in 2014, we endeavor to include all comers wishing to contribute and collaborate on
						these civic projects and goals, without a specific focus on coding. Thus our pending legal name change to <em>Innovate for Vegas Foundation</em>, to be
						more inclusive and to look forward, not backward…
					</p>

					<h4>Purpose</h4>
					<p>
						To enable and encourage civic ideation, innovation, and implementation to make our communities better.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means focusing the energies of local innovators on our local communities for local innovation that Makes our Smart City Smarter.
					</p>
					<h4>Ethos</h4>
					<p>
						Our core principles are essential:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Inclusivity</li>
						<li>Diversity</li>
						<li>Accessibility</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These principles apply not only to project participation, but also to all meetups, gatherings, online publications, project
						deployments, and ongoing development of any type of work product. We invite all those interested in learning, contributing,
						and collaborating on civic projects designed to improve our communities, to do so with confidence and conviction!
					</p>
					<h4>Mission</h4>
					<p>
						We will invite members of the population at large to build an organization centered on civic volunteerism, skills development,
						and job creation, with a focus on Making our Smart City Smarter, improving Education, and driving our 3-word ethos:
						Inclusivity, Diversity, Accessibility.
					</p>
					<h4>Policies</h4>
					<p>
						Please find the latest versions of our policies on GitHub, visible using your web browser visiting these links:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct - Innovate for Vegas Foundation</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing to Projects - Innovate for Vegas Foundation</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						tl;dr: Be civil at least, enable and encourage, elevate don’t castigate and above all if you are interested (and interesting?) you are invited so come on
						down and get involved!
					</p>

					<h3>Public Charity Determination and Donations!</h3>
					<p>
						As of 12 October 2022, Code for Vegas Foundation has received our determination letter from the IRS; we are a 501(c)(3) public charity retroactive to 16 June 2022 when we
						formed this Nonprofit Corporation in the State of Nevada. Our name change will flow to the IRS shortly, our EIN and determination status will not be effected.
						You can find our Foundation in the <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/">IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search</a>, where a copy of our Determination Letter may be found
						in the Final Letter section.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our official re-naming with the IRS will be finalized with one letter and our 990 filing, then an update to our EIN name, update the banks and other services and vendors…
						There is always some red tape to cut through. 
					<p>
						Would you like to support our local innovators and local innovation, which is entirely civic volunteerism in action? Any donations you would care to
						make via the Stripe.com link below, are tax deductible per our 501(c)(3) public charity determination and tax exempt status.

					<h3>We Are Global!</h3>

					<p>
						As is the case so often with Open Source Projects, all of our work is open to collaboration with others in the civic volunteer universe.
					</p>
					<p>
						According to the <a href="https://www.lvcva.com/research/">Las Vegas Convention and Visitor Authority</a> there are approximately 40 million people visiting our Oasis in the Desert
						for 2023 (give or take), and we would like very much for those visitors to try civic volunteer projects out for themselves! And, to bring their experiences back home with them, so they
						will understand the value of time spent by volunteers to make their communities better, where they live each day and when they visit other places.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beginning July 1, 2023, we have asked Mary Fey Long Norris to join our Board of Directors (and she has!) to help us reach out to civic volunteers all over the United States, to collaborate
						on our projects and to bring theirs to our little test site, so that more people from more places can learn about what we do to elevate our communities and perhaps make things work a little bit better,
						and maybe make some ideas come to life for people to try…

					<h3>Ongoing Initiatives</h3>
					<p>
						Each month we add another project topic to the mix, as part of our pursuit of the overall Capstone Projects.
						The monthly topic focus is valuable alone, but as part of the overall project plan each contributes more value to
						the whole than each individual part.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Open Transit</strong> was the very first monthly topic and aims to bring project development to Las Vegas locals who may themselves
							use our public transit system, or know someone who does. This is an ongoing project.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Open Data Capture Platform</strong> is a modification of the second monthly topic, Earth Month, but increased substantially in scope
							and relevance. The City of Las Vegas has a substantial collection of Open Data datasets published online, this project will aim to enable crowd-sourced
							open data collection as well as modern methods of software access to these data for creative uses that we have yet to think of. This is an ongoing project.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Smart Social</strong> is the way a Smart City communicates with itself. Rather than relying on Nextdoor or Twitter or other social media platforms,
							the goal is to make use of modern and open standards, tools people have at their disposal without requiring installation of proprietary and questionable
							software or other products, and ideally built with our ethos in mind (this includes language translations and general accessibility). This is an ongoing project.
						</li>
						<li><strong>My Muni</strong> is the Human Interface for our (and your) Smart City. Rather than asking people to install mobile applications on devices they may not own, we will
							attempt to build open standards interfaces to Open Data and other services and information so that more people have more access to more information and interaction.
							This is an ongoing project.
						</li>
						<li><strong>vLocal</strong> is an essential component of the online and, eventually, offline real-world experience of what we all know as Locals. People who are a part of
							the communities that are Las Vegas, whether within the city limits, a little bit farther away in Southern Nevada, or maybe much farther away but visiting now and then.
							Ideally this project will focus on secure communication credentials as well as secure online identities to facilitate participation in the
							various other projects (Smart Social, My Muni, etc) while addressing concerns around identity compromise. This is an ongoing project.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Welcome</strong> is like our My Muni project, where we examine and consider our city and communities from the perspective of visitors, whether
							they are tourists, sports fans, conference attendees, in to see family and friends, or simply passing through, a Smart City can be a great experience for
							temporary visitors, not only providing a delightful time among locals, but gifting them when some impressions to bring home with them, and to look forward to next
							time they come by!
						</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<h3>Capstone Initiatives</h3>
						<p>
							Do we need more projects? Of course! Each monthly project focus is not only useful and valuable on its own, but each will come together as part of a larger project
							with even more general utility than each of the individual projects we tackle each month (and again, these are always ongoing projects). Each monthly project, and each
							capstone project, will bring job skills development and, ideally, actual jobs to participants, whether that participation is in the form of software code development,
							graphics, human interface, media development, content creation, artistic works, internationalization and localization efforts, accessibility checks, quality assurance,
							and even marketing, sales, and project management. Each role is essential and each contributor gets credit for their effort from start to finish.
						</p>
					<h4>Virtual Vegas</h4>
						<p>
							Virtual Vegas is a Digital Twin implementation, making maximal use of Open Data datasets and all of the specific topics addressed month over month,
							the goal is to enable the smartest of smart applications and other projects developments to enable discovery, learning, and participation in our Smart City. It would
							be easy to compare this project to something like Civilization or Sim City, and both of those would be valid comparisons, but this project will aim to be a platform on which
							someone might build a game similar to these, or develop open news tools, neighborhood communications tools, safety visualizations, and so on. The possibilities are endless!
						</p>
					<h4>Education</h4>
						<p>
							This is a capstone in the earliest phases of planning and discussion. Early thinking is to enable a more flexible education platform for students of all ages in the Las Vegas
							area, adapting what was learned during school closures in pandemic lockdown intervals, adaptation to different learning styles, and enabling learning at different rates
							for different students, especially in cases where there might be a teacher staffing shortage. If Making our Smart City Smarter is the ultimate goal of the Innovate for Vegas
							Foundation, Education and an educated populace are the bedrock foundation on which this goal is best built.
